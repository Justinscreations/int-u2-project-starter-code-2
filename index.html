      <P class="box-text">Racial Inequality, at least in America, has been a thing ever since the founding of America. However, even after the abolishment of slavery, people still refused to acknowledge African Americans as real people. It got to the point where the south denied former slaves access to jobs or other services by segregation laws known was the "Jim Crow" laws. While those laws cease to exist now, the ideology of refusing African Americans still lives on in the present world. </P>

      <h2 class="text-h2">Why it still exists</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
      <p class="box-text">It's believed that racial inequality exists still due to many people's beliefs and behaviors, or being taught to discriminate by their family when they were a kid. Sometimes, even bad experiences in the past can create that hate in someone.</p>

      <h2 class="text-h2">How we can stand against it</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 3 below. -->
      <p class="box-text"> What we can do is celebrate other people's culture to spread diversity, call out any kind of hate speech, teach our children that they should accept anyone, work with one another, and finally support human right organizations.
